build different things parallaly, and store their cache in same folder, max ccache 20GB, try downolading cacche in background too while source syncing

30G needs 30 min to upload, stop build at 330min, then start uploading artifacts, same for 5 workers

run another ubuntu for minitues 360-32/50, ubuntujob

source download needs 32-50 mins

need:ubuntujob, download source for another 5 mac, do the same what previous 5 did

matrix: api-stubs-docs, system-api-stubs-docs, test-api-stubs-docs,  aex
1. init : make init
2. zygot: make app_process
3. system_server : make services
4. java framework : make framework
5. framework resources : make framework-res
6. jni framework : make libandroid_runtime
7. binder : make libbinder

assign two matrix per machine make aex is last step
